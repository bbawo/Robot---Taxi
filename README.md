# Robot---Taxi
In this project I take you to future by building a self-driving taxi. Giant companies like Tesla, Waymo, Google, Uber, etc etc are all working on this technology to make transportation efforless. No one has to struggle to move from point A to point B. This is what I share with such tech giants and tried to build a mini-version robot myself.

The goal of my robot is to autonomously nagivate a multi-routed track, recoginze traffic symbols and obey traffic them,  and also taxi passengers from point A to point B using the coordinates which will be communited wirelessly by the passenger.

This was a fun project in which I learned a lot. 

I provide the raw code available here and plan to make a detailed writeup explaining every step very soon.
